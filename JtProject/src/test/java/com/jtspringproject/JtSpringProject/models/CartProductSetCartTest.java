"""
  Scenario 1: Test if the cart is set correctly

  Details:  
    TestName: testCartIsSetCorrectly
    Description: This test is meant to check if the cart is set correctly when a valid cart object is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Cart object.
    Act: Invoke the setCart method with the created Cart object as parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the cart field in the class with the Cart object passed.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the cart object passed is correctly set in the class. This is important because if the cart is not set correctly, it can lead to incorrect calculations or operations related to the cart.

  Scenario 2: Test if null cart is handled properly

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullCartHandling
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method can handle a null cart object properly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to arrange any data as we are passing null.
    Act: Invoke the setCart method with null as parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the cart field in the class is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle null inputs correctly. This is important because if the method does not handle null inputs correctly, it can lead to NullPointerExceptions.

  Scenario 3: Test if the cart is replaced correctly when a new cart is set

  Details:  
    TestName: testCartReplacement
    Description: This test is meant to check if the existing cart in the class is replaced correctly when a new cart is set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two new Cart objects. Invoke the setCart method with the first Cart object as parameter.
    Act: Invoke the setCart method again with the second Cart object as parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the cart field in the class with the second Cart object.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the existing cart is replaced correctly when a new cart is set. This is important because if the cart is not replaced correctly, it can lead to incorrect calculations or operations related to the cart.
