Scenario 1: Validating the assignment of a User object to the customer attribute

Details:  
  TestName: testValidCustomerAssignment
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful assignment of a User object to the customer attribute using the setCustomer method. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User object with valid data.
  Act: Invoke the setCustomer method with the created User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the customer attribute with the User object that was passed.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the customer attribute correctly holds the User object that was passed to the setCustomer method. This test is significant as it verifies the basic functionality of the setCustomer method.

Scenario 2: Validating the assignment of a null value to the customer attribute

Details:  
  TestName: testNullCustomerAssignment
  Description: This test is meant to check the assignment of a null value to the customer attribute using the setCustomer method. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary for this test.
  Act: Invoke the setCustomer method with null as parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the customer attribute is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the customer attribute correctly holds a null value when null is passed to the setCustomer method. This test is significant as it checks the setCustomer method's handling of null values.

Scenario 3: Reassignment of the customer attribute

Details:  
  TestName: testCustomerReassignment
  Description: This test is meant to check the reassignment of the customer attribute using the setCustomer method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two User objects with different data. Invoke the setCustomer method with the first User object.
  Act: Invoke the setCustomer method again with the second User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the customer attribute with the second User object.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the customer attribute correctly holds the second User object after the reassignment. This test is significant as it checks the setCustomer method's ability to handle reassignments.
