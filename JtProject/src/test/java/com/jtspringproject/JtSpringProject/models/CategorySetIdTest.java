Scenario 1: Valid ID Assignment Test
Details:
  TestName: setIdValidAssignment
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setId method correctly assigns the provided integer id to the private variable id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and prepare a valid integer id.
  Act: Invoke setId method with the prepared id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the id field of the instance has been set to the provided id.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the setId method correctly assigns the provided id to the id field. This is important as it ensures the correct setup of an instance with the given id.

Scenario 2: Negative ID Assignment Test
Details:
  TestName: setIdNegativeAssignment
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setId method when provided with a negative integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and prepare a negative integer id.
  Act: Invoke setId method with the negative id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the id field of the instance has been set to the negative id.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that setId method handles negative values correctly. This is important in ensuring that the class can handle erroneous inputs.

Scenario 3: Zero ID Assignment Test
Details:
  TestName: setIdZeroAssignment
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setId method when provided with a zero integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and prepare a zero integer id.
  Act: Invoke setId method with the zero id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the id field of the instance has been set to zero.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that setId method handles zero values correctly. This is important in ensuring that the class can handle edge case inputs.

Scenario 4: Large ID Assignment Test
Details:
  TestName: setIdLargeAssignment
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setId method when provided with a large integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and prepare a large integer id.
  Act: Invoke setId method with the large id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the id field of the instance has been set to the large id.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that setId method handles large values correctly. This is important in ensuring that the class can handle a wide range of inputs.

Scenario 5: Repeated ID Assignment Test
Details:
  TestName: setIdRepeatedAssignment
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setId method when invoked multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and prepare different integer ids.
  Act: Invoke setId method with the different ids sequentially.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the id field of the instance has been set to the last provided id.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that setId method handles repeated assignments correctly. This is important in ensuring that the class can handle multiple setup changes.
