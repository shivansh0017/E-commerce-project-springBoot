"""
  Scenario 1: Test to validate the correct ID returned by getId() method.

  Details:  
    TestName: testValidIdReturned.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getId() method is correctly returning the ID of the entity. The ID is a unique identifier for every entity and should be returned correctly. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an entity with a known ID.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method on the entity.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the known ID of the entity.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getId() method correctly returns the ID of the entity. The expected result is the known ID of the entity. This test is significant as it ensures the correct ID is returned, which is important for the identification of entities.

  Scenario 2: Test to validate the null ID case for getId() method.

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullIdReturned.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getId() method handles the case where the ID of the entity is not set (i.e., null). 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an entity without setting an ID.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method on the entity.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ID is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getId() method correctly handles the case where the ID is not set. The expected result is null. This test is significant as it ensures that the method can handle cases where the ID is not set, preventing potential null pointer exceptions.

  Scenario 3: Test to validate the automatic generation of ID by getId() method.

  Details:  
    TestName: testAutoGeneratedIdReturned.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getId() method correctly returns the auto-generated ID of the entity. When an entity is created, an ID should be automatically generated if it is not set. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an entity without setting an ID.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method on the entity.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ID is not null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getId() method correctly returns the auto-generated ID of the entity. The expected result is a non-null ID. This test is significant as it ensures that an ID is always assigned to an entity, which is important for the identification of entities.
