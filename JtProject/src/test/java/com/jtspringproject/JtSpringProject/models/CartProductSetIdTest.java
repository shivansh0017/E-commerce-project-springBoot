Scenario 1: Setting a valid ID

Details:  
  TestName: setIdWithValidValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setId correctly sets the ID of the object when provided with a valid integer value. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and an integer with a valid value.
  Act: Invoke the setId method with the valid ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the ID of the object has been correctly set to the provided value.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the ID of the object has been correctly set. The expected result is that the ID of the object matches the provided value. This is significant as it validates that the setId method works correctly with valid input.

Scenario 2: Setting a negative ID

Details:  
  TestName: setIdWithNegativeValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setId correctly handles the scenario when provided with a negative integer value. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and an integer with a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the setId method with the negative ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the ID of the object remains unchanged or throws an exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the ID of the object has not been set to a negative value. The expected result is that the ID of the object remains unchanged or an exception is thrown. This is significant as it validates that the setId method correctly handles invalid input.

Scenario 3: Setting an ID to zero

Details:  
  TestName: setIdWithZeroValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setId correctly handles the scenario when provided with zero as an integer value. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and an integer with a value of zero.
  Act: Invoke the setId method with the zero-value ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the ID of the object remains unchanged or throws an exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the ID of the object has not been set to zero. The expected result is that the ID of the object remains unchanged or an exception is thrown. This is significant as it validates that the setId method correctly handles edge case inputs.
