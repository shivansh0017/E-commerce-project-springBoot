Scenario 1: Test to check if the product is set correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testProductIsSetCorrectly
  Description: This test is meant to check if the product is correctly set using the setProduct method. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and the class where the setProduct method is declared.
  Act: Call the setProduct method with the created Product instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the product field in the class is the same as the created Product instance.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the product is set correctly. The expected result is that the product field should be the same as the created Product instance. This test is significant as it ensures that the setProduct method is functioning correctly.

Scenario 2: Test to check if null product is handled correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testNullProductHandling
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setProduct method can handle null values correctly. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class where the setProduct method is declared.
  Act: Call the setProduct method with null.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the product field in the class is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the product is set to null correctly. The expected result is that the product field should be null. This test is significant as it ensures that the setProduct method can handle null values correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the setProduct method affects other fields

Details:  
  TestName: testSetProductDoesNotAffectOtherFields
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setProduct method does not affect other fields in the class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class where the setProduct method is declared. Set some initial values for the id and cart fields.
  Act: Call the setProduct method with a Product instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the id and cart fields are still the same.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the setProduct method does not affect other fields. The expected result is that the id and cart fields should remain the same. This test is significant as it ensures that the setProduct method does not have side effects.
