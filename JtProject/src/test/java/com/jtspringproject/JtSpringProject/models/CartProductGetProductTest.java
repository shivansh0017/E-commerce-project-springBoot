Scenario 1: Test to validate if getProduct method returns null when product is not set
Details:  
  TestName: testGetProductReturnsNullWhenNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getProduct method correctly returns null when the product is not set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the product is initially null.
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned product is null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the getProduct method correctly handles the case when the product is not set. This is significant because it confirms the method's ability to handle null values, which is a common edge case in programming.

Scenario 2: Test to validate if getProduct method returns correct product when it is set
Details:  
  TestName: testGetProductReturnsCorrectProductWhenSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getProduct method correctly returns the product when it is set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the product to a specific value.
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned product matches the set product.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the getProduct method correctly returns the product that was set. This is significant because it confirms that the method is functioning as expected when retrieving a product.

Scenario 3: Test to validate if getProduct method is thread-safe
Details:  
  TestName: testGetProductIsThreadSafe
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getProduct method is thread-safe, i.e., it behaves correctly when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the product to a specific value. Create multiple threads that will invoke the getProduct method.
    Act: Start all the threads.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if all threads retrieved the correct product.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the getProduct method is thread-safe. This is significant because it ensures that the method behaves correctly in a multi-threaded environment, which is a common scenario in java applications.

Scenario 4: Test to validate if getProduct method does not modify the product
Details:  
  TestName: testGetProductDoesNotModifyProduct
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getProduct method does not modify the product.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the product to a specific value.
    Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the original product has not been modified after the getProduct method is invoked.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the getProduct method does not modify the product. This is significant because it confirms that the method follows the principle of data immutability, which is important for maintaining data consistency in the application.
